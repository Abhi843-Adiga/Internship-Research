OVERVIEW:   
This repository documents the  technical work carried out during my internship, which involved research,simulation and practical implementation of electromics circuits.       
The internship work consisted of two projects described below        

BITE FORCE SENSOR :      
This project focuses on study and implementation of bite force sensory system which detects the bite force of an indivisual. The objective was to analyze the circuit behavior through simulation and validate the results
using breadboard prototyping.      

Works Performed:    
-> Circuit analysis and design
-> LT Spice based simulation.
-> Breadboard Implementation.

TRANSCRANNIAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION :
This project includes techniques such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS), which non-invasively modulate brain activity using low-intensity scalp-applied currents. This project emphasized understanding practical challenges and theoretical 
simulation using LT-SPICE.   

Works Performed:    
-> Research and Circuit study.
-> LT Spice based simulation.

Tools & Technologies:      
-> Spice simulation tool (LT-SPICE).
-> ESP32 WROOM32 M4, MCP6004 Op-Amp,6N137,HCNR201,0.96 TFT LCD and FlexiForce Sensors.
-> Multimeter.
